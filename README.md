# creadique

There are plenty of books in the world, we tend to only speak about how good a book or an author is.
There is an abundance of information in modern world, in this case written in the books,
but human attention is still extremely limited.
Knowing what not to pay attention is as important, if not more important, then knowing what to pay attention to.
Knowing what not to commit your time and energy into, is as important, if not more important, then knowing what to.
In *creadique* we try to inform each other that some of the books might not be as good as they seem, from the 
first glance.
The fluent writing of a text should not deceive the reader about the holes of meaning and reason in it.
And so, also, not so beautiful prose should not disappoint the reader, if there are jewels of wisdom in there.
Popular books are just like any other popular thing, most of them are just that, popular, without much of a value
in themselves. Here in creadique we try to expose those books, so that they won't get much of a chance of swallowing
our mental and not so mental resources.
Be the literary critique the world needs, share what you have seen and think that most of the people missed.
Be the literary sceptic the world needs, share the harsh truths about the books that you think 
most of the people overlook. And don't forget to rate those shared by others.
